# Linux Terminal Project

This project is a simple terminal emulator that aims to replicate some of the basic functionality of a Linux terminal. It features several built-in commands such as cd, pwd, ls, mkdir, rmdir, wget, cp, mv, rm, help, clear, and exit.

To run the terminal, simply compile and run the main.c file. The terminal will then continuously prompt for input until it is closed.
